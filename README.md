Learning using a GitHub Tutorial

My name is Danielle.  I'm a young programmer.  I graudated from college with my bachelor's in computer science.  I am currently 24 years old.  I have not yet earned a job in my field, but I'm looking forward to using GitHub as I work to continue to improve my skills.

I also enjoy playing video games, watching anime and creative writing.

There, I put something in the README file.  Done.
